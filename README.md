## How to use

Coming soon.

## Provisional Feature List

Sleep Tracker → Users will be able to add new date and specify the quality of sleep
(when the user went to bed, when the user woke up, and to specify overall how he/she was satisfied with the quality of sleep). All dates will be kept in a list and the user will be able to compare his sleeping schedule between days or between weeks. User is also able to set the goal for how many hours to sleep per night, so depending on the day, he/she will get messages if they didn't achieve enough sleep for that day (or for that week).

Calories Intake Tracker → Users will be able to track what they eat every day. Users will be able to see the whole list of all days where they kept track of eating records. Each day will have a button where users will be able to see details for that day (e.g. how many calories per meal, what meal they ate and so on). Users will also be able to keep track of nutrients they want to eat for that week and set goals for eating habits. 

Exercise Tracker → Users will be able to track their workouts and organize them by the dates in the table. Type of exercises will be sorted in the categories and the users will be able to filter the categories and then compare their progress throughout the weeks. They will also be able to keep a record of what exercises they do in a particular workout session, how many sets for each exercise and how many repetitions for each set.

Water Intake Reminder → Users will be able to set an optimistic goal of how much water they need to drink per day. Then according to the specified number, the algorithm will divide it by the number of glasses of water that cover the daily goal, and it will send reminders accordingly and other details if necessary.

Login Page & User Profile → Personal data is recorded and saved for each user. Such personal data includes: weight, height, age, and gender. If the user's goal is to lose weight, they would be able to keep track of their progress.

Todo List → Users can add and keep track of their daily goals and reminders.
